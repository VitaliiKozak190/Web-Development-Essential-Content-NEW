            <p>Healthy food is delicious. Doing sport is enjoyable. You just need to start - people said. Nonsense! - I
                thought. To me,
                a 19-year-old guy, overweight and depressed, who ate tons of junk food to seize the stress, those
                healthy-life-gurus
                sounded like aliens coming from another planet. On their planet, it must have sounded right. On my
                planet,
                eating pizza
                was OK and jogging was exhausting. 12 years later, after I shed almost 100 pounds and completely changed
                my
                diet, I
                still believe we WERE on different planets. The thing is that once I escaped.

                Now I'm a coach with 7+ years of experience who founded the chain of sport clubs each having a fitness
                bar
                and
                assistance of psychologists, and dietitians. I'm sure that nothing will work until you know where you
                are
                and where you
                go. Possibly, you are now on the planet Fatness and want to escape it. Here I am to show you the way
                out.
                The gym itself
                is the spacecraft for you to reach a happy new life, with its fitness bars to adapt your body to new
                conditions and with
                friendly crew to motivate you and help on your way.</p>
